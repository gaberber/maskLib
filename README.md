# MaskLib - Designing Superconducting Qubits

To install, create a conda environment specific to masklib (or just install everything in the same python environment, I'm not a cop).
Then, navigate to this folder and install the package as:

```
pip install -e .
```

This should be editable and will change as you push/pull to this repo.
